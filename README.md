Alternative use of ClipSkip 1 or 2

## 24 dream_like_sam_kuvshino
A mixture of Dreamlike Diffusion 1.0, SamDoesArt V3 and Kuvshinov style models.

Created mostly for exploring different character concepts with a focus on drawings, but the mix happened to be pretty good at realistic-ish images, all thanks to wonderful models that it uses.

## 25 DucHaitenAIart
v3.1 is able to receive more diverse, more detailed prompts with gorgeous colors and more realistic shadows. The image has the breath of 3D anime, but the material is much more realistic. The weak point is that some celebrity images are no longer in the model, a bit too 3d anime might make some people dislike, the image of the teeth is a bit lacking in detail.

## 26 elldreths_lucid_mix
This mixed model is a combination of my all-time favorites AND new-found favorite, Dreamlike (thanks to JustMaier for the heads-up). A genuine simple mix of a very popular anime model and the powerful and Zeipher's fantastic f222 mixed in with Dreamlike (minus sd1.5).

## 28 faetastic_v1
The model is also extremely versatile, it can do beautiful landscapes, excels at semi-realistic characters, can do anime styles if you prompt it to (you need to weight anime tags though), can do NSFW, works beautifully with embeddings and LORAs and also has the fantastic noise offset built in to produce rich dark beautiful images, if you ask it to!

Generate beautiful Asian girls, NSFW.

## 33 knollingcase
The images on the following imgur link were all made just using 'knollingcase' as the main prompt
